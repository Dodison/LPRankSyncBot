# LPRankSyncBot
LPRankSyncBot is a bot for Discord and Sponge Minecraft-Server. It synchronizes the Minecraft LuckPerms ranks with Discord Roles.
The program can only run from your servers directory.

## Usage

### Download and instalation
1. Download the appropriate executable for your system from the 
<a href="https://github.com/Dodison/LPRankSyncBot/releases" target="_blank">release page</a> of this repo
2. Put the executable into your sponge servers folder
3. Run the executable

### Configuration
The program includes a configuration wizard but because of the limitations of a console application it's not very reliable and it is recommended to manually change the configuration. To do so edit the Properties.json and RoleDict.json files in LPRSB Directory generated by the wizard.

#### properties.json
example:
```
{
"DatabaseType":"SQLite",
"UsernameChannel":636579284798013489,
"Token":"",
"SyncDelayMin":20
}
```
DatabaseType: What database the Luckperms plugin uses

Username channel: ID of the channel where people put in their minecraft name

Token: Discord bot token. <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html" target="_blank">more info</a>

SyncDelayMin: how often should the program automatically synchronize (in minutes)

#### Roledict.json
example:
```
{
"New": 636173403895758857,
"admin": 636173373042327582
}
```
"Name of Luckperms group": ID of Discord role
